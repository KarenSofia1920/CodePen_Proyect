    <h1> What awaits humanity in the technological future?</h1><br>
    <h2>The singularity</h2></p> 
    <p> The singularity is that point in time when all the advances in technology, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI), will lead to machines that are smarter than human beings. Kurzweil's timetable for the singularity is consistent with other predictions,– notably those of Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son, who predicts that <em>the dawn of super-intelligent machines will happen by <strong>2047.</strong></em> <br>

<br>But for Kurzweil, the process towards this singularity has already begun.

“That leads to computers having human intelligence, our putting them inside our brains, connecting them to the cloud, expanding who we are. Today, that’s not just a future scenario,” Kurzweil said. <strong>“It’s here, in part, and it’s going to accelerate.”</strong> <br>

    <h2>Scientific positions against and for</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Daniel Dennet,  in his book From the bacterium, from Bach to the back explains that the singularity does not have intelligence in itself, but skills of understanding impossible to reach the complex human machine.</li>

            <li>Stuart Hameroof, explain about the singularity the netx: Im trying to say that whatever consciuosness is, it's not a computation ... It's not a physical process which can be described by computation.            </li>
